# Data Cleaning and Manipulation

This project focuses on utilizing Python for data cleaning, manipulation, and preparation. The goal is to preprocess raw customer data, identify and treat outliers, engineer new features, and perform clustering analysis to group customers based on their behavioral patterns.

By applying techniques like Isolation Forest, feature engineering, and K-Means clustering, the project aims to provide actionable insights into customer segmentation and support decision-making for marketing strategies.
